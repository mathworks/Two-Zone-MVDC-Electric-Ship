This submission demonstrates modeling and simulation of a Two-Zone MVDC electric ship in Simscape Electrical, 
and considers modeling constructs for both desktop and real-time simulation. More information on the
architecture and parameterization of the system is available from the ESRDC at the following link
https://www.esrdc.com/library/documentation-for-a-notional-two-zone-medium-voltage-dc-shipboard-power-system-model-implemented-on-the-rtds/. 

To get started,

Run Two_Zone_MVDC.prj

and

Read Two_Zone_MVDC_Electric_Ship.pdf

Models compatible with R2022b have a '_R2022b' extension on the filename.
